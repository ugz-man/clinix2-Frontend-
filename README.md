## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

This app provides easy access to personalized health information, eliminating the constant wait for doctor’s appointments or the need to reach out for answers to personal health questions. Whether you're seeking quick insights or general guidance, the app offers helpful support. However, for serious concerns or confirmation, it's always recommended to consult a medical professional. This app serves everyone and can be used by anyone.

For simple concerns like leg pain, headaches, or more private matters you may not feel comfortable discussing—such as wet dreams—this app offers access to information. It helps you understand potential causes, track patterns, and explore possible ways to manage or alleviate the symptoms just by asking questions.
